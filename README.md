# XSRlib (C/C++)
XSRlib is a small Collection\ of all XoShiRo LFSR-PRNG's.\
This Project aims to bring a small and compact "library", 
that comes with all the functionality and tools you need to use XoShiRo,
without sacrificing speed and efficiency.

Im using the original referencecode taken from [unimi](http://prng.di.unimi.it/),
but heavily modified in order to make it as compact as possible without loosing speed.\
As for the special tools it will come with,
I only planned so far to include tools to initialize the generators and
to generate numbers uniformly in a specified interval.

## Current Progress
XSRlib is still in Beta state.

Development is almost done, everything considering code is Implemented (at least i think so).\
The only things left for me to do are:
- Review the code for any mistakes and last minute optimizations (including syntax)
- Add proper preprocessor statements for configuration of features
- Write the f*cking documentation...
