# XSRlib (C/C++)
XSRlib is a small Collection\ of all XoShiRo LFSR-PRNG's.\
This Project aims to bring a small and compact "library", 
that comes with all the functionality and tools you need to use XoShiRo,
without sacrificing speed and efficiency.

Im using the original referencecode taken from [unimi](http://prng.di.unimi.it/),
but heavily modified in order to make it as compact as possible without loosing speed.\
As for the special tools it will come with,
I only planned so far to include tools to initialize the generators and
to generate numbers uniformly in a specified interval.

## Current Progress
XSRlib is currently in the alpha state, as everything has to be done manually right now.\
It is also currently not threadsafe which is anouther target of this Project.\
On top of that I haven't made any documentation yet (, this will come in the future though).
